Server
------

The Rematch server is built on top of the Django framework, which has it's own built-in administration panel granting full control of database obejcts stored in the database.
It is accessible through https://SERVER_URL/admin/ and can be used to create or delete users, remove or edit projects or files, and even delete specific annotations and vectors.

Django's admin panel can be used for fine-tuned control over data available to through the Rematch server, but it's main functionality is managing users, projects and files.
