Usage
=====

Server
------

The Rematch server is built on top of the Django framework, which has it's own
built-in administration panel granting full control of database obejcts stored
in the database.
It is accessible through https://SERVER_URL/admin/ and can be used to create or
delete users, remove or edit projects or files, and even delete specific
annotations and vectors.

Django's admin panel can be used for fine-tuned control over data available to
through the Rematch server, but it's main functionality is managing users,
projects and files.

Login
+++++

Before uploading a file, starting a matching task or creating a project, a user
must log in. If you do not have a user account on a rematch server, you'll need
to contact the nearest rematch server admin, or set up your own rematch server.

By clicking the "Login" command in the rematch toolbar or menu, a prompt dialog
box will appear. You'll need to specify the server, username and password
you'll work with, and click Login. Upon a successful login you'll be able to
create projects, add files, request matches, etc.
